## Important: This script is not necessary for normal YouTube accounts!

If your YouTube account is restricted and you are unable to watch videos while logged in, you can try using this script.

### This script will not restore your account from a restricted status!

The script works by changing the video to an embed format and re-embedding it for playback. However, **if your account is also restricted from viewing videos in embed mode, this script will not be effective**.
