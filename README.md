## This scripts will not restore your account from a restricted status!

If your YouTube account is restricted and you are unable to watch videos while logged in, you can try using this script. Otherwise, you don't need to install it.

The script works by changing the video to an embed format and re-embedding it. If it doesn't work properly, please try refreshing the page (F5).
